title="Modeling and dynamics simulation for deformable objects of orthotropic materials",

journal="The Visual Computer",

year="2017",

month="Oct",

day="01",

volume="33",

number="10",

pages="1307--1318",

abstract="Simulation of physically based deformable models is a hot topic in computer graphics. Most of the existing models focus on isotropic materials and some on transversely isotropic materials. We propose a modeling method for orthotropic materials, which exhibits different mechanical behaviors along three orthogonal directions. First, constraints for the strain energy density in linear elastic models are analyzed, and a positive-definite elasticity tensor is derived for an orthotropic material. Second, an orthotropic deformation controlling frame-field is conceptualized and a frame construction tool is developed for users to define the desired material properties. A quaternion Laplacian smoothing algorithm is proposed, and several user-defined rotation minimizing frames are propagated into the entire body of the deformable object, which forms a smooth frame-field. Third, the corotational linear FEM model coupled with the orthonormal frame-field is formulated to realize a dynamics system, which can deal with large deformations. All the algorithms have been implemented in a comprehensive modeling and simulation system, and a GUI is provided to design the orthotropic model. Experiments on real-time deformation simulation and analytical comparisons are presented.",

abstract="Until relatively recently, researchers in computer graphics paid scant attention to the numerics of their computations. Computation was used as a simple tool to evaluate algorithms or transform data into some appropriate pictoral representation. Thus standard computer graphics texts have little to say about numerical methods, just as earlier numerical analysis textbooks had little to say about computer graphics. This is now changing, for the important reasons outlined in this paper.",
