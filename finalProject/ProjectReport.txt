 As per final project guidelines, I will be implementing a 3D object and apply respective operations on it.
 For my project, I have choosen "A Snooker Table" as an object.
 In this assignment, I have given 2D elevations of a snooker table such as Top View, Front View and Side View and will use this design as my final project object (elevations can be found in hw3.html file).


In future home work assignments (weekly project submissions), I will try to make and improve actual representation of a snooker table with more accurate colors, lights, camera angles, etc.
Some of the features I will try to implement:
- A snooker table with more accurate color and design
- Focus light from top should be considered for lights and shadows
- Some snooker balls on the table for more interactive view
- Transformations such as Translate, Rotate, Scale, SHere
- Different Camera Views and lighting conditions
- Views from different perspectives
- Some environmental background such as wall, some extra tables, windows, etc.


To implement this project, I will use WebGl with JavaScript for programming because of its many advantages.
- WebGL is a JavaScript abstraction over OpenGL that utilizes the Canvas element to display content 
- WebGL lets us render 3d graphics without using plugins
- WebGL supports different hardware extensions
- WebGL is supported in all major web browsers
- Additionally, graphical display technologies such as css, svg, bootstrap, jquery can be used

I hope to perform better in all next submissions and learn many new skills.
