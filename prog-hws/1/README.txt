As the Problem statement says, I have created an interface for 2D primitive rendering algorithms using Bresenhams Line Algorithm and 
Midpoint Circle Algorithm. There are 6 buttons provided for different purpose: Line, Circle, Ellipse, Rectangle, Polygon, Polyline.
By clicking on each of them implements a said function. For example, by cliking on Line button, a line will be popped up.
I tried but couldn't figure out how to draw Ellipse so dropped it. Apart from Ellipse, other buttons respond with their functions.

Line and Circle: Line and Circle buttons prints a line and a circle.

Rectangle, Polygon and Polylines: These buttons prints respective shapes and can be re-spawned by clicking again and again.
I used some references while programming this assignment and listed them below.
