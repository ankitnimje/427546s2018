Question1.html and Question2.html are main files to open question 1 and question 2 using most web browsers. 

Question 1: 
Inputs can be provided are: Primitives(Line, Polyline, Polygon, Rectangle,.... I avoided Circle and Ellipse due to errors I was facing), Ratio (Please provide denominator or 1) and Number of iterations (Please limit iterations to as as small as possible to avoid system slowdown).
Providing these inputs a successful fractals for selected primitives will show up. Number of ratio will divide line into number of input provided. Iteration will subdivide the sublines created by ratio.


Question 2:
Inputs which can be provided are: 'Driver's Score' and  'Radius of Tyre'.
Driver's Score can be between 2 to 100. 2 will just give a straight line which is impossible to implement in given scenario.
As in questions, less than or equal to 80 will give polygon wheels with sides equal to DriverScore.
81 to 99 will give ellipse wheels and a perfect 100 score will give a perfect circle.

I also provided functionality to change colour of Fractal lines and Wheels but there are some glitches.
